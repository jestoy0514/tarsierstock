# tarsierstock
A simple stock management system using Python3, Tkinter, and SQLite3.

This program is created in the intention of helping small business
manage their stock simple and less mess than writing in a book.
Since it is using SQLite3 it is very easy to back-up the database.
Just copy or upload to online storage the file "inv_database.db" file
and it is done.

This readme is just a sample readme because I am a beginner in programming
so I don't have that much idea on how to setup things. So it may look like
stupid in your eyes but I am doing the best I can to come up with best free
stock management software for small businesses.

Thank you and have a nice day.
